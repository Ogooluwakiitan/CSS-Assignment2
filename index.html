          So far, I have learnt HTML and it's various Elements and Attributes used
          to <b>Structure</b> a web page. CSS is used to add different
          <b>Styles </b> to your website or Web page. CSS attributes includes
          <i>width, height,padding, border, color, fonts and so on</i> to your
          websites. CSS is important because it helps in styling your codes and
          making them beautiful.

          <b>Padding</b> is the space between the content element and the element
          border. Padding has four properties which are
          <i>Padding-top, Padding-right, padding-bottom and padding-left.</i> It
          is one of the CSS Box Model.

          <b>Margin</b> is also a CSS Box Model and it's properties are used to
          define the space around elements. It is the outer-most box model, its

          <b>Border </b> is used to set the border on an element. Border
          properties are
          <i>border-style, border-color, border-width and border-radius</i>. They
          are used to specify the color and size of the border of an element.
